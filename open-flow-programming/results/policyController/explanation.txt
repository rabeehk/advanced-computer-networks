We use the discovery packet in order to be able to identify the switches and the links between them.
Then we identified the MAC of the host with IP 10.0.0.4 (host 4) and added specific rules for the three switches:

* for s1, it should send packets to s3 if destination is H4
* s3 should forward only packets to H4
* s2 should reply to H1 and H2 only through s1
